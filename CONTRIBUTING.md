# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Pull Request Titles

Pull request titles should start with one of the following emoji, whichever best describes the primary changes happening in the PR:

- 🐎 - Performance improvements
- 🐛 - Bug fix
- 🆕 - New feature
- 📝 - Documentation/content change
- ♻️ - Refactor
- 📌 - Dependency Change
- 💎 - User/Developer Interface/Experience change

Optionally, one of the following scopes should be included in parenthesis after the emoji.

- `site`
- `functions`
- `build`
- `tests`
- `content`

Title should have a space between either the emoji and the start of the title, or the clothing parenthesis of the scope and the start of the title. There should be no space between the emoji and the opening parenthesis of the scope. We have automation in place to check your PR titles to help you out.

All together a PR title should look something like this:

- `🐎 Improve performance of everything`
- `📌(build) Update build tool version`

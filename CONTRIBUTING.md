# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Bugs or Feature Requests

Thanks for your feedback! For bugs or features for Chrome OS itself, please [file a defect](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Defect+on+Chrome+OS) on the Chromium bug tracker and follow-up there for updates. For the chromeOS.dev site, [file an issue in this repo](https://github.com/chromeos/chromeos.dev/issues/new/choose) and a team member should reply shortly. Please follow these best practices when filing an issue here for us:

- Please create or follow-up on an issue, and have a discussion with a maintainer about the issue in the issue, before filing a PR.
- Please include as much information as possible about your browsing context when filing a bug report
- Be respectful of the maintainers' time and other priorities.

While we appreciate all feedback, please understand that accepting changes, especially creating new content or changing existing content, is at the maintainers' discretion.

Linux (Beta) on Chrome OS, sometimes called Crostini, allows you to run Linux apps for development alongside your usual Chrome OS desktop & apps. Linux (Beta) on Chromebooks offers developers the best of both worlds. Built and designed with Chrome OS’ principles of simplicity and security, Linux on Chromebooks gives devs the freedom to safely run their favorite editors, IDEs, and thousands of world-class dev tools in one container.

Turning on Linux (Beta) will install a Terminal that you can use to run command line tools. You can also install graphical apps like editors and IDEs that show up in the Launcher alongside the rest of your Chrome OS apps. Another useful tool, the Files app, makes it easy to create shared folders for moving files between the Chrome OS host and the Linux container.

Benefits:

- Run the most popular developer tools
- Set up an Android, Web, or Flutter development environment
- Test Android or Web apps on your Chromebook or test on a separate device [via USB](/{{locale.code}}/android-environment/deploying-apps#connect-to-adb-over-usb) or [port-forwarding](/{{locale.code}}/web-environment/port-forwarding)
- Easy backup and restore of your Linux container

Once you have [enabled Linux](/{{locale.code}}/linux/setup) you can learn how to configure a [productive desktop environment](/{{locale.code}}/productivity), build for [Android](/{{locale.code}}/android-environment) or [Web](/{{locale.code}}/web-environment), and also work on [games](/{{locale.code}}/games). We also have advanced guides to setup [Flutter](/{{locale.code}}/android-environment#install-flutter-on-chrome-os) and other common Linux development [tools](/{{locale.code}}/linux/setup#installing-linux-apps-and-packages).

Chrome OS [supports](https://chrome.googleblog.com/2016/05/the-google-play-store-coming-to.html) the Google Play Store for users to discover and install apps and games. Developers can use Google Play to seamlessly distribute and monetize apps & games across Chrome OS and Android (mobile, tablets, foldables, TV, and Wear).

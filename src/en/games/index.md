Chrome OS devices have large screens and often have built in mice and keyboards, this makes them great gaming devices, for both web and Android games.

While most mobile-centric games run just fine, to provide the absolute best experience for your users check out the topics in [Adapting Android games](/{{locale.code}}/games/adapting-games-android) to help bring optimized layouts, perfect input, and the best performance to your game.

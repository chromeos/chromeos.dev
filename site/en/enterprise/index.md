Chrome OS is the speedy, simple and secure operating system that powers every Chromebook.

Security is at the center of Chrome OS. It has an active protection system that fights external attacks and helps mitigate employee negligence. Granular policy control gives system administrators the ability to immediately act when issues take place, by managing devices remotely (e.g. wiping, disabling, managing approvals for apps, etc). The system receives frequent updates that happen in the background, ensuring that the platform is protected against threats.

It also offers a rich platform to build [web apps](/{{locale.code}}/web) that can be deeply integrated with the operating system. The apps are powered by the Chrome browser and have access to the [latest APIs and advanced capabilities](/{{locale.code}}/web/powerful-pwas).

Chrome Enterprise admins can leverage a rich set of tools to distribute and install applications among the different parts of the organization.

All these features make ChromeOS a great option for enterprise developers and system administrators alike, and a powerful tool to empower users inside an organization.

## Advanced web experiences for the enterprise

With Chrome at the heart of Chrome OS, your web apps and extensions run on an always improving fast, safe, secure, and capable platform. Chrome OS offers full support for [Progressive Web Apps](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) and allows the use of a set of [advanced capabilities](/{{locale.code}}/web/powerful-pwas). These apps can be deeply integrated with the operating system allowing for advanced tasks that were previously only possible with a native app.

In addition to standard web technology, developers can build [Chrome Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/overview/) that provide their own set of [APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/) that can run on their own or alongside a web app to improve its functionality.

These options give developers great flexibility, allowing you to adapt your solutions to the needs of your organization, while achieving a fast development pace.

## Ease of distribution

Chrome OS offers a number of ways to [distribute apps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IyqOMYwZK9fi0bTmYZiDHRZ-ZW5j7ytvEorHqcMZRw/edit?resourcekey=0-UbgvQgkWNXqeNsw-f4Uktg#), making the collaboration between developers and system administrators more efficient. Developers can directly share a web app’s URL with Chrome Enterprise admins to install it for their [organizational units](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182537). Chrome Extensions can be uploaded to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), which allows for different ways of listing the apps and has its own rules and policies, or “self-hosted”, giving you more control over the distribution process.

Having these options lets you accelerate the feedback loop with your customers or clients.

## A mode for every business need

The great variety of use cases in the enterprise world demands different ways to configure, install, and run apps on devices. Chrome OS offers different modes to adapt to the needs of every organization and user.

**[Kiosk Mode](/{{locale.code}}/education/whats-kiosk-mode)** allows Chrome Enterprise admins the ability to deploy apps that run in fullscreen mode (via a policy) without requiring the user to be signed in.This is useful for signage or customer-driven ordering Users don’t need to be signed in to complete the task, or interact with other parts of the OS, which makes Kiosk a perfect fit.

**User session mode** let Chrome Enterprise Admins deploy apps to organizational units, so that when any user signs in on a device or browser, they’re available without needing to be individually installed**[Managed Guests Sessions (MGS)](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3017014)** is similar, but provides a full browsing experience without requiring a user to sign in. This can be very useful for things like loaner devices and shared computers.

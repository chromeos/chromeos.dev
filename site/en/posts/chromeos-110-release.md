ChromeOS 110 was released for beta on January 12, 2023 and reached stable release on February 9, 2023. This new iteration of ChromeOS brings with it a number of security fixes, alongside features such as faster parental approvals, enhanced Bluetooth call quality, and improved assistive feedback.

## Channel labeling: easily see which channel you're on

Trying out the latest version of ChromeOS? If you're on a non-stable channel (such as Beta, Dev, or Canary), you can see which channel you're on. Channel labeling now appears next to the **Battery Icon** on the bottom right of your screen.

Select the **Time** and open **Quick Settings** to access a new UI that includes your device build and a button to submit feedback.

## Parental approvals: quickly approve blocked websites

Quickly approve blocked websites on your child's Chromebook without the [Family Link App](https://families.google/familylink/). When blocked from accessing a website, your child can ask you to approve their request in person.

For more details, see [Manage your child's account on Chromebook](https://support.google.com/families/answer/7680868?hl=en).

## Bluetooth headsets: hold higher quality calls

Sound more natural in calls and conferences when using a Bluetooth headset. Your ChromeOS device now increases call quality by reconstructing the high-frequency audio components that are not transmitted from Bluetooth headsets.

## ChromeOS Camera App: automatically detect low storage

Manage your storage more effectively when using the [ChromeOS Camera App](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/4487486?hl=en). Now, if ChromeOS Camera detects that your system storage is running low, it shows a warning messageâ€”and stops recording before using all your storage.

## Assistive feedback: get predictive, inline assistance

Get the answers you need faster. As you share your problems, concerns, or suggestions through the [Google Feedback form](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/2982029?hl=en), Assistive Feedback returns related help articles to help you self-diagnose your problems.

## ChromeOS 110 is available now

ChromeOS 110 hit stable release in early February, bringing with it the above features and a variety of smaller enhancements. Other features include improvements to [Select-to-speak](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9032490?hl=en) and the ability to view PostScript Printer Description (PPD) information across network printers.

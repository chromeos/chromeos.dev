The [27th Annual Webby Awards Winners](https://winners.webbyawards.com/winners) have been announced. We're thrilled to share that [ChromeOS.dev won three Webby Awards](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2023/websites-and-mobile-sites/mobile-specific-features-design/best-mobile-visual-design-function/250073/chromeos) across two categories:

- People's Voice: [Websites and Mobile Sites: Web Services & Applications](https://winners.webbyawards.com/winners/websites-and-mobile-sites/general-websites-and-mobile-sites/web-services-applications?years=0)
- People's Voice: [Websites and Mobile Sites: Best Mobile Visual Design - Function 2023](https://winners.webbyawards.com/winners/websites-and-mobile-sites/mobile-specific-features-design/best-mobile-visual-design-function)
- Webby Winner: [Websites and Mobile Sites: Best Mobile Visual Design - Function 2023](https://winners.webbyawards.com/winners/websites-and-mobile-sites/mobile-specific-features-design/best-mobile-visual-design-function)

Since 1996, the [Webby Awards](https://www.webbyawards.com/about/) have awarded excellence on the web, presenting awards for eight media categories ranging from Websites and Mobile Sites to Podcasts. The International Academy of Digital Arts and Science, a panel of over 2,000 industry experts, votes on Webby Winners—while the public votes on People's Voice awards. With over 14,000 entries from all 50 U.S. states and over 70 countries worldwide, the 27th Annual Webby Awards continues to be the leading international award honoring excellence on the Internet.

We share the Web Services & Applications award with [Interview Warmup](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2023/websites-and-mobile-sites/general-websites-and-mobile-sites/employment/246536/interview-warmup) by Google Creative Lab, who was the Webby winner. The two of us were in good company this year, with [14 other Google projects winning awards](https://winners.webbyawards.com/search?years=0&awards=0,1,3&sort=0&searchTerm=google) and numerous other Google projects being nominated. We'd like to congratulate our fellow Googlers on their nominations and wins and encourage you to check out their work, too.

## Design meets code

From inception, ChromeOS.dev was designed to be a dedicated resource: a blueprint to help developers create best-in-class experiences for ChromeOS. To deliver apps that truly improve people's lives, developers must be equipped with the right tools, resources, and best practices. From technical documentation and code samples, to the latest ChromeOS product news, to examples of how others created inspiring experiences for ChromeOS—we want to ensure what you need is at your fingertips. With that in mind, in 2020, we created ChromeOS.dev.

In March 2022, to [celebrate ChromeOS 100](/{{locale.code}}/posts/chromeos-100), we embarked on a redesign of our site. We partnered with [BASIC/DEPT®](https://www.basicagency.com/), a global brand and experience agency–who, by the way, was awarded the [Webby Agency of the Year](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2023/specialachievement/332/basicdept) this year.

Adaptability and flexibility are core tenets of ChromeOS.dev, and it extends throughout all aspects of the site. All designs start content-first and flow out, adapting to our users no matter how they choose to access the site. We blend visual fidelity with a deep understanding of modern web development techniques to provide an experience that feels custom-tailored to the device you're viewing it on. This was made possible by leveraging intrinsic design principles and capabilities stemming from CSS Grid, Flexbox, container queries, and more, and a close collaboration between visual designers and frontend developers. (It's also [open source](https://github.com/chromeos/chromeos.dev), if you want to check it out for yourself.)

**Bonus:** Did you know we have a secret easter egg theme for the site? Open up your developer tools, type `m100.start()` into them, answer some questions, and if you get them all right, you'll be treated to our awesome Phosphor theme!

## Growing with the ChromeOS community

We’re so thankful to the ChromeOS community for all your support and for recognizing us with the two Webby People’s Voice awards. At ChromeOS.dev, our goal is to make ChromeOS development accessible to everyone. We continue to look for ways to improve our web experience and the accessibility of our documentation.

Thank you for joining us on this journey!

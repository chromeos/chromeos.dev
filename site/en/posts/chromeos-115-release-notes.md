ChromeOS 115 reached stable release [on July 20, 2023](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule). Highlights of ChromeOS 115 include updates to app streaming, a new floating window state, and the ability to pause casting when sharing your screen.

## App Streaming on ChromeOS

As of ChromeOS 115, App Streaming enhances the [Phone Hub](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/10480029) experience, by allowing users to see and interact with streamed apps running on their Pixel phone. When a user receives a mirrored conversation notification from their Pixel phone, tapping on that notification kicks off an app stream directly to the user's ChromeOS desktop. This is part of a [Google-wide ambient computing](https://www.blog.google/products/android/io22-multideviceworld/) effort.

## Floating windows on ChromeOS

In Chrome 115, a new window layout menu in ChromeOS helps to accelerate common actions like split-screening two windows. In addition, we're adding a new window state, float, which allows users to set a window as always-on-top.

## Pause cast for cast moderator

While using [cast moderator](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/11587567), sometimes users need a quick way to pause what they are casting from their device. In ChromeOS 115, with **Pause cast**, you can now pause what you cast to the shared screen on a still image, while you do something else on your computer. In ChromeOS Quick Settings or from Chrome browser Cast menu, select Pause to display the last casted screen on the cast receiver. While paused, other actions you perform on your computer are not cast to the cast receiver. When cast is resumed, your computer starts mirroring to the cast receiver again.

## Enhanced signature options for PDF toolkit

In ChromeOS 115, the Gallery PDF toolkit makes it easier for users to sign their documents, allowing for the creation of a free-hand signature that is saved in the app for subsequent use. Gallery is the ChromeOS media multi-tool that provides users with fast, consistent, and discoverable ways to view, tweak, and route various media types.

## Seamless, secure connection to Wi-Fi networks

Passpoint streamlines Wi-Fi access and eliminates the need for users to find and authenticate a network each time they visit. Once a user accesses the Wi-Fi network offered at a location, the Passpoint-enabled client device will automatically connect upon subsequent visits. Wi-Fi Passpoint is now supported on ChromeOS through supported Android applications. Wi-Fi Passpoint is a set of Wi-Fi mechanisms defined by the Wi-Fi Alliance that facilitate and automate the provisioning and configuration of secure Wi-Fi networks while also minimizing user intervention. Once provisioned, whenever a compatible and secured Wi-Fi network is in range, ChromeOS can automatically connect to it without the need for user interaction.
Other ChromeOS 115 updates include:

- **Expanded language packs:** Some Google Text-to-Speech voices that were previously preinstalled are now downloaded over the network when they are needed. This frees up some space on the ChromeOS device.
- **New keyboard Shortcut app:** The new Shortcut App offers a new navigation and taxonomy, easier in-app search functionalities and a refreshed shortcut visualization.

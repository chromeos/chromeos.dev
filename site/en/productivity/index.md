Whether you’re just getting started as a developer or transitioning from another platform, Chrome OS has a number of built-in features designed to help keep you productive. Chrome OS includes a number of productivity features you're used to from other platforms, like global keyboard shortcuts, touchpad gestures, and virtual desks to keep you organized. You can customize keyboard bindings and touchpad settings to make you as productive as possible, and access other computers through SSH or remote desktop software. You can even enable experimental features to test before they hit the OS, or enter developer mode to take full control of the operating system. With all that Chrome OS has to offer, you can get productive, and stay productive, quickly.
